## Sudoku Web App
 Sudoku web app is a legacy sudoku game on the internet running in your browser.
 The sole purpose of this game is to just check my html js and flask routing skills. 
 This app is deployed on Heroku here :- https://sudoku-web-game.herokuapp.com/
## How to play Sudoku game
 Actually I know almost 80% of you know how to play sudoku game and rest 20% can google it but just to fill this Readme file and also for those 20% people who won't use Google I will tell how to play this game.
    In Sudoku there is a grid of 81 (9x9) cell i.e 9 cell in a row and 9 cell in a column there are 9 subgrid contaning 9 cell (3x3). There are some cell pre filled (called hints) depending upon level of difficulty.
    Now we have to fill the grid with number 1-9 keeping in mind that no number repeat in a row, coloumn & sub grid .You can read detailed explanation with example somewhere on inernet just google it.

## Now let's Talk about code:
 As the name suggest this web app or website is made with the help of flask frame-work of python and you can see the percentage of language used on the github Lanuguage used
1. python (Flask-Framework)
2. Html 
3. JavaScript & jquery (ajax)
4. cascadle style sheet (css) 

 Python is used to generate the sudoku and solve it. Javascript and Jquery is used to send data to backend python server and show the result in frontend and various logical operation in frontend 
    CSS for styling .

I think that's enough.
One more think I am open to collab so you can updated the source code and put it on your repo or can send pull request just mail me at backend.nktechnical@gmail.com after making request or you can report a bug.
